# Thesis project proposal

At this point you know how to build a reliable app, and how to work collaboratively.

It’s time to step it up for your final project. You’re going to be working in team and fully simulate a real-world engineering environment!

This app is also going to be the most complete project that you’ll have in your portfolio at the end of the course.

## Getting started

To send your project proposal:

1. Form a team with 2 to 4 classmates (sit next to each other if you’re in the same campus, or connect through a video call if you’re working remotely).
2. Together choose a project that you’d like to work on.
3. One of you should fork this repo (it doesn’t matter who).
4. Edit the `proposal.md` file, adding the required data.
5. Commit your changes.
6. Send a pull request.

We will review your proposal and give you feedback before the project starts, to make sure it’s aligned with the course learning goals.
